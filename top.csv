v1l,10,33643784,11,1668711412,Ask HN: Is document discovery and staleness a challenge for you?,story,,"In my years of experience working on teams and now with client teams, I&#x27;ve observed this repeatedly: (internal) documents are written and rarely if ever, updated again. Worse yet, often no one knows some documents&#x2F;wikis&#x2F;memos exist, which doesn’t bode well for knowledge sharing and awareness.<p>The problem is particularly bad with Google docs (can never find anything) but not much better even if you&#x27;re using Notion et al. May be it&#x27;s that these tools are dumb in that they purely focus on the single document editing experience, not on the organization or consumption aspect of a document tool.<p>I know there&#x27;s a people aspect to it, but I also know that if I&#x27;m not even aware of a document&#x27;s existence and can&#x27;t easily find it, there&#x27;s nothing one can do.<p>Not looking for solutions here but more like thoughts or lived experience if you relate to the problem.",
