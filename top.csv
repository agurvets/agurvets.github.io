* Eat a strict carnivore &#x2F; keto diet for a year
* Get stronger
* Be more flexible<p>I know what you’re thinking: It doesn’t cost much to eat healthy, go for walks, buy some running shoes. But these things never last for me.<p>I’m 47. Overweight (240lb), and I suffer from chronic digestive issues and inflammation. I’ve tried on and off for years everything under the sun but I just can’t stick with it. I run out of will power.<p>I’ve spent tens of thousands of dollars to figure out what’s going on with my body and this is what I know:<p>- I need to eat strictly carnivore (or Keto Low FODMap)
- I need to lose weight.
- I want to get strong.
- I need to stretch.<p>Whenever I try and do these things myself it works for a few weeks, and then I go back to old habits. I’m done trying the same thing over and over, and then failing. Instead of a stupid cyber truck I want to buy good health.<p>If you were me, and you could spend 50k to get healthy. How would you overcome these will power issues?<p>Looking for creative ideas please. I don’t want to die early, and don’t want the diabetes….etc. 
that’s coming down the pipeline if I continue this way.<p>I know you can&#x27;t buy discipline. But can I kick start it somehow? How would you do it?<p>I&#x27;ve read all the books, tried all the apps, need something that&#x27;s a higher level of intervention.<p>Side note: There might be a startup here. How many millionaires out there are happy to spend 100k for a high-touch, guaranteed upgrade to their health and well being?",
