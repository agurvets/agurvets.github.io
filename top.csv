yihac1,8,47049743,34,1771347668,Show HN: 6cy – Experimental streaming archive format with per-block codecs,story,https://github.com/byte271/6cy,"Hi HN,<p>I’ve been experimenting with archive format design and built 6cy as a research project.<p>The goal is not to replace zip&#x2F;7z, but to explore:
• block-level codec polymorphism (different compression per block)
• streaming-first layout (no global seek required)
• better crash recovery characteristics
• plugin-based architecture so proprietary codecs can exist without changing the format<p>Right now this is an experimental v0.x format.
The specification may still change and compatibility is not guaranteed yet.<p>I’m mainly looking for feedback on the format design rather than performance comparisons.<p>Thanks for taking a look.",github.com
