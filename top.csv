sim04ful,23,44144451,70,1748701258,Show HN: Fontofweb – Discover Fonts Used on a Website or Websites Using Font(s),story,https://fontofweb.com,"Hey HN,
I&#x27;ve been working on fontofweb.com on and off for the past 4 years, and I&#x27;m keen to share it with you. It lets you type in the URL of any website and see exactly how the fonts are used: all the weights, line heights, and sizes.<p>A big plus is that it doesn&#x27;t require a Chrome extension, unlike a lot of other tools in this space.<p>You can also search for a specific font and find websites using it. For example, check out sites using Inter: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fontofweb.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;inter"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fontofweb.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;inter</a>. This reverse font search even supports looking for multiple fonts at once, like here’s an example with Inter and Space Mono: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fontofweb.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;inter&#x2F;space-mono"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fontofweb.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;inter&#x2F;space-mono</a>.<p>My goal with Font of Web is to build up a comprehensive database of font usage across the web. By collecting and analyzing this data, I believe we can uncover some valuable trends, such as:<p>* Common font pairings * Popular heading fonts over time * Market share of commercial fonts * Top font foundries based on actual usage<p>I originally built a version of this four years ago and was surprised by how much organic interest it received.<p>I’ve now rebuilt the tool from scratch, moving away from browserless.io — which was quite expensive — to an invisible iframe approach with a proxied URL to handle CORS (it’s a straightforward solution, and I’m rather surprised it isn’t discussed more often). This change has completely eliminated all costs related to web scraping.<p>Here&#x27;s the Tech Stack:<p>* Remix + HeroUI + Tailwind * Rust Backend in Axum * Authentication with OTP email and Google social auth (via openidconnect) * Sqlite running on the same VPS as the API service * $5&#x2F;mo VPS * Cloudflare CDN * Cloudflare R2 for storage * Zeptomail for emails (very cheap and reliable, highly recommend!) * Simple Analytics: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dashboard.simpleanalytics.com&#x2F;fontofweb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dashboard.simpleanalytics.com&#x2F;fontofweb.com</a> * Logging: Journalctl :)<p>There are currently 275 websites in the database, and I&#x27;m working on increasing this. Stats are available at: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.fontofweb.com&#x2F;stats"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.fontofweb.com&#x2F;stats</a>.<p>While the main site doesn&#x27;t need an extension, for more robust searching and to help with Cloudflare-protected sites, there’s a chrome extension available.<p>There&#x27;s also a public API for domains that have already been checked. For instance: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.fontofweb.com&#x2F;report?domain=apple.com&amp;path=&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.fontofweb.com&#x2F;report?domain=apple.com&amp;path=&#x2F;</a>.<p>There&#x27;s also RSS feed I’ve got no idea why you would need this directly, but I&#x27;m using it because Pinterest allows you to automatically populate boards with an RSS. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.fontofweb.com&#x2F;rss"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.fontofweb.com&#x2F;rss</a><p>Appreciate your thoughts and feedback",fontofweb.com

Cloud version (free during testing):
   <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rigorous.company"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rigorous.company</a>
- Upload your manuscript
- Get a comprehensive PDF report within 1–2 working days
- No setup required<p>2. Self-hosted version (GitHub):
   <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;robertjakob&#x2F;rigorous"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;robertjakob&#x2F;rigorous</a>
   - Use your own OpenAI API keys
   - Full control over the review process
   - Customize agents and criteria
   - MIT licensed<p>The system is particularly useful for researchers preparing manuscripts before submission to co-authors or target journals.<p>Would love to get feedback from the HN community, especially from PhDs and researchers across all academic fields. The project is open source and we welcome contributions!<p>GitHub: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;robertjakob&#x2F;rigorous"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;robertjakob&#x2F;rigorous</a>

ponta17,9,44143244,30,1748686637,Show HN: I built an AI agent that turns ROS 2's turtlesim into a digital artist,story,https://github.com/Yutarop/turtlesim_agent,"I&#x27;m a grad student studying robotics, with a particular interest in the intersection of LLMs and mobile robots. Recently, I discovered how easily LangChain enables the creation of AI agents, and I wanted to explore how such agents could interact with simulated environments.<p>So, I built TurtleSim Agent, an AI agent that turns the classic ROS 2 turtlesim turtle into a creative artist.<p>With this agent, you can give plain English commands like “draw a triangle” or “make a red star,” and it will reason through the instructions and control the simulated turtle accordingly. I’ve included demo videos on GitHub.
Behind the scenes, it uses an LLM to interpret the text, decide what actions are needed, and then call a set of modular tools (motion, pen control, math, etc.) to complete the task.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in LLM+robotics, ROS, or just want to see a turtle become a digital artist, I&#x27;d love for you to check it out:<p>GitHub: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Yutarop&#x2F;turtlesim_agent"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Yutarop&#x2F;turtlesim_agent</a><p>Looking ahead, I’m also exploring frameworks like LangGraph and MCP (Modular Chain of Thought Planning) to see whether they might be better suited for more complex planning and decision-making tasks in robotics.
If anyone here is familiar with these frameworks or working in this space, I’d love to connect or hear your thoughts.",github.com
