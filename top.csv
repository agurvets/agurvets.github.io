I already made a couple of mini-games using the body pose [1-3], and those were definitely fun to make and play! However, once the kids learned the tricks, they got bored. I could only produce that much content myself, and soon realized that I lack time for churning out games.<p>Finally, I decided to tap into an endless pool of PC games, preferrably simple and less addictive ones like the Gameboy and DOS games.<p>This project has been also inspired by [4], which has been featured on HN recently.<p>[1]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mristin&#x2F;pop-that-balloon-desktop"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mristin&#x2F;pop-that-balloon-desktop</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mristin&#x2F;cactusss-desktop"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mristin&#x2F;cactusss-desktop</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mristin&#x2F;ski-leu-desktop&#x2F;"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mristin&#x2F;ski-leu-desktop&#x2F;</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;everythingishacked&#x2F;Semaphore"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;everythingishacked&#x2F;Semaphore</a><p>Edit: clarified title; layout of references",github.com
