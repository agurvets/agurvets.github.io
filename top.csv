The tool features interactive network visualization powered by Cytoscape.js, with real-time graph editing and manipulation capabilities. It supports JSON import&#x2F;export and provides a responsive design that works seamlessly on the desktop (mobile-friendly version coming later).<p>The tech stack combines modern frontend technologies with robust backend architecture. The frontend uses Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Cytoscape.js for the visualization engine. The backend is built with FastAPI and Python.<p>The featured demo showcases a Traumatic Brain Injury Nasal Spray mechanism of action visualization, demonstrating the tool&#x27;s capability to handle complex biological pathway mapping.<p>You can explore the live demo at &lt;<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodes.bio"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodes.bio</a>&gt; to see the TBI Nasal Spray visualization in action, along with other biological network examples.<p>I&#x27;d love feedback on the visualization capabilities or any suggestions for biological data integration.
