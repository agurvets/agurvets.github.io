agy,31,35264273,13,1679505998,Ask HN: Are there banks/crypto companies immune to bank run?,story,,"With SVB and other banks having issues now, with crypto companies with stable coins (UST for example) collapsing, I’m wondering why there is no bank&#x2F;crypto company that just holds your money 1:1, so even there is a bank run they can return all the money. You need some revenue to operate a company, but you can do it by charging customers a monthly fee and keep money as is without investing it anywhere and do not provide deposit&#x2F;loans services, just storing your money and providing money transfer services (wire, checks, debit cards). Is it just eventually any company would love to earn more, so they invest it in some assets thus increasing the risk or something else?",
