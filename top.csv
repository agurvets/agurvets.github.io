Despite these efforts, outbreaks are not uncommon. Even vegetables like bean sprouts and onions are commonly associated with outbreaks.<p>Made me wonder, why don&#x27;t we just blast food with a short burst of radiation before&#x2F;after packing?<p>Or if it is used, why isn&#x27;t it more common?",

It&quot;s more hack-for-exploration than a production ready shell, but here it is! Hope somebody finds it anywhere near as interesting to check out as I found making it.<p>Disclaimer: I know about xonsh and love it (if you haven&#x27;t heard of it, google it). This project is more pure python and less python and bash interacting - see the readme for more details.",github.com
