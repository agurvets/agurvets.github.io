hvasilev,24,33489253,25,1667711487,Ask HN: How do you discover features in unknown code bases?,story,,"I&#x27;m realizing that one of the reasons why I don&#x27;t do a lot of additional hobby programming is because I&#x27;m missing a fundamental skillset that I never developed (in a reliable way) over the years. I think I don&#x27;t know how to discover features that I&#x27;m interested in, in code bases that I&#x27;m unfamiliar with.
Example: In Chromium I want to find the algorithm that is building the DOM. I&#x27;m not sure if that is even part of the code base (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;chromium)
How would you personally approach this problem?",
