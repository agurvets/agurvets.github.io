denizkavi,20,46515777,81,1767721796,Launch HN: Tamarind Bio (YC W24) – AI Inference Provider for Drug Discovery,story,,"Hi HN, we&#x27;re Deniz and Sherry from Tamarind Bio (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tamarind.bio"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tamarind.bio</a>). Tamarind is an inference provider for AI drug discovery, serving models like AlphaFold. Biopharma companies use our library of leading open-source models to design new medicines computationally.<p>Here’s a demo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;luoMApPeglo"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;luoMApPeglo</a><p>Two years ago, I was hired at a Stanford lab to run models for my labmates. Some post-doc would ask me to run a set of 1-5 models in sequence with tens of thousands inputs and I would email them back the result after setting up the workflow in the university cluster.<p>At some point, it became unreasonable that all of an organization&#x27;s computational biology work would go through an undergrad, so we built Tamarind as a single place for all molecular AI tools, usable at massive scale with no technical background needed. Today, we are used by much of the top 20 pharma, dozens of biotechs and tens of thousands of scientists.<p>When we started getting adoption in the big pharma companies, we found that this problem also persisted. I know directors of data science, where half their job could be described as running scripts for other people.<p>Lots of companies have also deprecated their internally built solution to switch over, dealing with GPU infra and onboarding docker containers not being a very exciting problem when the company you work for is trying to cure cancer.<p>Unlike non-specialized inference providers, we build both a programmatic interface for developers along with a scientist-friendly web app, since most of our users are non-technical. Some of them used to extract proteins from animal blood before replacing that process with using AI to generate proteins on Tamarind.<p>Besides grinding out images for each of the models we serve, we’ve designed a standardized schema to be able to share each model’s data format. We’ve built a custom scheduler and queue optimized for horizontal scaling (each inference call takes minutes to hours, and runs on one GPU at a time), while splitting jobs across CPUs and GPUs for optimal timing.<p>As we&#x27;ve grown to handle a substantial portion of the biopharma R&amp;D AI demand on behalf of our customers, we&#x27;ve expanded beyond just offering a library of open source protocols.<p>A common use case we saw from early on was the need to connect multiple models together into pipelines, and having reproducible, consistent protocols to replace physical experiments. Once we became the place to build internal tools for computational science, our users started asking if they could onboard their own models to the platform.<p>From there, we now support fine-tuning, building UIs for arbitrary docker containers, connecting to wet lab data sources and more!<p>Reach out to me at deniz[at]tamarind.bio if you’re interested in our work, we are hiring! Check out our product at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.tamarind.bio"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.tamarind.bio</a> and let us know if you have any feedback to support how the biotech industry uses AI today.",

bulba4aur,15,46526088,28,1767792155,Show HN: KeelTest – AI-driven VS Code unit test generator with bug discovery,story,https://keelcode.dev/keeltest,"I built this because Cursor, Claude Code and other agentic AI tools kept giving me tests that looked fine but failed when I ran them. Or worse - I&#x27;d ask the agent to run them and it would start looping: fix tests, those fail, then it starts &quot;fixing&quot; my code so tests pass, or just deletes assertions so they &quot;pass&quot;.<p>Out of that frustration I built KeelTest - a VS Code extension that generates pytest tests and executes them, got hooked and decided to push this project forward... When tests fail, it tries to figure out why:<p>- Generation error: Attemps to fix it automatically, then tries again<p>- Bug in your source code: flags it and explains what&#x27;s wrong<p>How it works:<p>- Static analysis to map dependencies, patterns, services to mock.<p>- Generate a plan for each function and what edge cases to cover<p>- Generate those tests<p>- Execute in &quot;sandbox&quot;<p>- Self-heal failures or flag source bugs<p>Python + pytest only for now. Alpha stage - not all codebases work reliably. But testing on personal projects and a few production apps at work, it&#x27;s been consistently decent. Works best on simpler applications, sometimes glitches on monorepos setups. Supports Poetry&#x2F;UV&#x2F;plain pip setups.<p>Install from VS Code marketplace: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.visualstudio.com&#x2F;items?itemName=KeelCode.keeltest"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.visualstudio.com&#x2F;items?itemName=KeelCode...</a><p>More detailed writeup how it works: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keelcode.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-keeltest"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keelcode.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-keeltest</a><p>Free tier is 7 tests files&#x2F;month (current limit is &lt;=300 source LOC).
