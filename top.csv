I started anti-depression meds over the last week but haven&#x27;t seen any changes for the better.<p>Currently i&#x27;m living a very dark chapter of my life, and i can&#x27;t do anything. Essentially i have anhedonia but also feeling guilty that i don&#x27;t do anything. I want to do something like read a book, watch a movie, study for my degree, search for work, but my thoughts go directly to &quot;It&#x27;s pointless&quot;, &quot;how reading a book will get you out of this mess, that&#x27;s partly your fault?&quot; (I appreciate that my depression doesn&#x27;t put all the blame on me hahaha), &quot;you will 100% fail&quot;, &quot;you are broken and not like the others&quot;, &quot;you can&#x27;t defend yourself if someone is trying to abuse your rights.&quot; etc.<p>The only thing i do every day is go out and try to be surrounded by others in social settings all the time. It kinda relaxes me.  Wake up -&gt; staying in bed for hours browsing mindless things on SM -&gt; go out and return early the next morning -&gt; sleep. Repeat.<p>The difficult part is that my feelings enforce my thoughts and vice versa.",
