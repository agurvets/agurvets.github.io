Does it affect how Medium &quot;exposes&quot; your article to the web?<p>I wrote two Medium articles as part of my job for my previous company and was happy with the overall experience, except this Freemium behaviour.<p>Will I&#x2F;my articles get negativity within dev and tech communities because they are written in Medium?<p>Thanks",

This includes things like optimizing sleep and nutrition, deliberate practice, mindfulness, and more. In the end, it&#x27;s about pushing yourself to be the best &lt;something&gt; you can be, in the same way athletes push themselves.<p>My question is: are there others who have similar attitudes towards their jobs? What is the best way to connect with them, e.g. is there an existing community here or on Reddit? If not, is there enough interest that I could create one?<p>Thank you!<p>*not professional, but Division 1 and then semi-professional. Good enough to be dedicated, not good enough to be impressive :)<p>PS: I want to make clear that this includes working in a healthy, sustainable way. I&#x27;m not pushing for rise-and-grind or hustle culture.",
