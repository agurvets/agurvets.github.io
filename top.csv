guzik,16,45549392,53,1760192675,Show HN: Aidlab – Health Data for Devs,story,,"Hey HN! I&#x27;m Jakub, and together with my co-founders Agnieszka and Nathan, we built Aidlab, a wearable that gives developers gold-standard physiological data.<p>Unlike health trackers with locked-down APIs, Aidlab ships with a free SDK [1] across 6+ platforms so you can just <i>pip install aidlabsdk</i> or <i>flutter pub add aidlab_sdk</i> or whatever platform (even Unity), and start streaming raw health data and events in real time with simple <i>didReceive*(timestamp, value)</i> callbacks.<p>Currently, we are exposing 13 data types including raw ECG, cough&#x2F;snoring, motion, raw respiration, skin temperature, bodyweight reps, body position, and 20 high-level stats like stress or readiness through the API.<p>The most common questions I got are:<p>1) &quot;how is it better than my smartwatch?&quot;<p>2) &quot;why we built it?&quot;<p>Chest-mounted wearables are considered the gold standard for physiological measurements. For example, whenever Apple validates their watch, they benchmark against chest straps [2], as some signals can only be reliably measured (or measured at all!) near the heart including continuous ECG, true respiration (based on lung volume changes) or body position&#x2F;orientation.<p>As for the second question: the problem for us was that smartwatches were too simple and the data too inaccurate, while advanced medical devices were too pricey or too complicated. We found a sweet spot between accuracy and accessibility - Aidlab delivers medical-grade signals without the hospital-level complexity. As &quot;medical-grade&quot; is a bold statement, we’ve published validation papers comparing Aidlab’s performance with other certified medical devices [3].<p>Today Aidlab is already a pretty mature concept. We&#x27;ve been building Aidlab for 2 years, shipped our first version in 2020, we got our first clients, including Bryan Johnson from Kernel&#x2F;Blueprint (longevity research) or Boeing&#x2F;Jeppesen (monitoring pilots’ bio-signals during tests&amp;training).<p>Now we&#x27;re about to release Aidlab 2 [4] - with additional signals like EDA and GPS, and a bunch of new features, including on-device ML (we&#x27;ve trained a few small LSTM models running inference with TensorFlow Lite for Micro). The cool part is that we&#x27;ve built a custom shell on top of FreeRTOS, letting anyone invoke POSIX-like commands directly on the device, for example:<p><i>timeout 10 temperature --sampling-rate 1 | tee &#x2F;data&#x2F;temperature.csv | tail -n 5</i><p>The biggest breakthrough for us was realizing that cloud-based processing was the wrong approach. In the beginning, we pushed most of the computation to the cloud - it seemed natural, but turned out to be slow, costly, and devs didn&#x27;t want it (&quot;hey, is there a way to use your product without cloud?&quot;). For example, our ECG analysis pipeline used to send raw data to an external microservice, processing it in 30-minute chunks through Bull queues. A 24-hour Holter analysis could spawn 100k+ event objects and take significant time to complete. Now we&#x27;re doing everything we can to move computation to the edge. In an ideal world, the cloud wouldn&#x27;t store or process anything - just receive already-analyzed, privacy-preserving results straight from the device.<p>Another lesson: don&#x27;t hand-solder prototypes at 3 a.m. to save money -&gt; please pay professionals to assemble PCBs.<p>We decided to showcase this now for three reasons:<p>- health feels more relevant than ever with the rise of longevity research and biohacking,<p>- we are close to finalizing Aidlab 2,<p>- and I am super curious to see if anyone here finds it useful!<p>If you&#x27;d like to check the quality of Aidlab for yourself, we are publishing free datasets every week during different activities [5].<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Aidlab"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Aidlab</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;Heart_Rate_Calorimetry_Activity_on_Apple_Watch_November_2024.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;Heart_Rate_Calorimetry_Acti...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aidlab.com&#x2F;validation"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aidlab.com&#x2F;validation</a><p>[4] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aidlab.com&#x2F;aidlab-2"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aidlab.com&#x2F;aidlab-2</a><p>[5] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aidlab.com&#x2F;datasets"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aidlab.com&#x2F;datasets</a>",
