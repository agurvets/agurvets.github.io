I made Peerdiem (a portmanteau word between Peer and Per Diem, which means Per Day in latin).

Backend consists of an FastAPI app deployed in a Docker container.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.artic.edu&#x2F;open-access&#x2F;public-api"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.artic.edu&#x2F;open-access&#x2F;public-api</a>",peerdiem.com
