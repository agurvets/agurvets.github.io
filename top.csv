That&#x27;s natural order of things of course, but because of limited opportunities of face to face contacts I didn&#x27;t really have a chance to listen to people&#x27;s problems and challenges. I work as full time software engineer, but also I do a lot of experiments and side projects. Because of that I&#x27;ve accumulated lots of different impressions and perspectives.<p>So I&#x27;m asking here: what would you like to read about, what are your current doubts about programming in general or related to dreaded by many subject of JavaScript and frontend frameworks. Is there any &#x27;next level&#x27; you&#x27;d like to reach?<p>This question can help many other people in situation similar to mine. Thanks!",
