cryptomeleon,5,26541376,17,1616423636,Show HN: Opytimizer – A Nature-Inspired Python Optimizer,story,,"<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gugarosa&#x2F;opytimizer"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gugarosa&#x2F;opytimizer</a><p>Did you ever reach a bottleneck in your computational experiments? Are you tired of selecting suitable parameters for a chosen technique? If yes, Opytimizer is the real deal! This package provides an easy-to-go implementation of meta-heuristic optimizations. From agents to search space, from internal functions to external communication, we will foster all research related to optimizing stuff.<p>Use Opytimizer if you need a library or wish to:<p><pre><code>    - Create your optimization algorithm;
    - Design or use pre-loaded optimization tasks;
    - Mix-and-match different strategies to solve your problem;
    - Because it is fun to optimize things.
</code></pre>
