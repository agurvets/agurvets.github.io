keernan,30,45700404,74,1761351666,Google Demanded My Drivers Lic Before Letting Me Read an Article,story,,"2025-10-24<p>ME: Yesterday I tried to read an article and google blocked me demanding I upload my driver’s
license, passport, or other information to prove my age (I declined). What was that all about?<p>GoogleAI: The prompt for age verification is due to Google&#x27;s new system, which uses AI to
estimate users&#x27; ages to comply with a global push for online age-verification laws. This system
may flag adult users as minors, restricting access to certain content until their age is confirmed
with a government ID, credit card, or a selfie.<p>How Google&#x27;s AI age verification works<p>• AI age estimation: Google&#x27;s system analyzes user activity, such as search history and
YouTube viewing habits, to estimate a user&#x27;s age.<p>• Widespread enforcement: While initially affecting only a &quot;small set&quot; of users, this
system is now rolling out more widely and affecting multiple Google services, including
Search, YouTube, and the Google Play Store.<p>• Restricted content: When the AI flags an account as potentially belonging to someone
underage, it applies the same restrictions as if the user had self-identified as a minor. This
includes turning on SafeSearch and restricting access to mature content.<p>• Incorrect flagging: The system is not foolproof and has been known to incorrectly flag
adult users, causing them to be locked out of content they previously accessed without
issue.<p>Your options for age verification
If your account was incorrectly flagged, you can verify your age using one of Google&#x27;s approved
methods:<p>• Government ID: Upload a photo of a government-issued ID, like a driver&#x27;s license or
passport. Google states it stores these documents securely and deletes them after your age
has been successfully verified.<p>• Credit card: Provide your credit card details to confirm your age. Any authorization is
temporary and will be fully refunded.<p>• Selfie: Use a selfie-based verification service.<p>Privacy concerns and context<p>For users who are hesitant to provide private documents to a large tech company, this situation
presents a privacy conflict. While it&#x27;s Google&#x27;s official process, providing personal information is
a risk many users are unwilling to take.<p>This initiative is driven by pressure from lawmakers in various countries, including the U.S. and
U.K., who are pushing for stricter age-verification measures to protect minors online. However,
this is also a highly debated issue, with concerns raised about the impact on adult users&#x27; privacy
and freedom of access to information.",
