To read any article, just prepend smort.io&#x2F; before a URL in a browser. (I recently found out that even 12ft.io&#x2F; uses the same technique). Smort is free to use and shareable links are valid for 7 days from creation. Permanent links will be supported soon.<p>I&#x27;m primarily a backend&#x2F;ML engineer so had to learn all things frontend to build Smort. I started out developing in SvelteKit and loved it but later migrated to React &amp; Nextjs due to better third party library support. I have lots of ideas on how to take Smort forward and would love for you all to use it. Please join our Discord to share your curated articles and feedback!<p>This is a walkthrough article detailing everything Smort can do at the moment - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smort.io&#x2F;demo-walkthrough"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smort.io&#x2F;demo-walkthrough</a>.<p>Smort&#x27;s name was inspired by the memes [1]<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=smort+meme&amp;tbm=isch"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=smort+meme&amp;tbm=isch</a>",smort.io

Lohitha · 1:32 PM<p>I described the problem: I suddenly lost data connection today and cannot reconnet to data
1:32 PM
L<p>I see that you are facing issues with the international data connection. I will help you to the best of my expertise.

I have documents that show that I have had covid recently
1:40 PM
L<p>Axxx, I completely understand.
I would have definitely helped you with this if there would have been any other alternative options.
Lohitha · 1:42 PM<p>I am returning to the US in 2 weeks: I even had to ask for a stay extension because I am sick. I hope you won&#x27;t cut off my service because I have Covid?
I can upload my doctor&#x27;s letter and a positive PCR test
1:44 PM
L<p>Unfortunately, we don&#x27;t have an option to provide exceptions for covid affected persons. I hope you understand.
