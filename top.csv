The search returned dozens of spam messages offering drugs in Asia and the US with information to contact on Wickr for price.<p>I reported these drug spam posts to LinkedIn - which is supposedly an anonymous report.<p>Next day I got a flood of reports on my own comments (nothing to do with that topic), so many I didn&#x27;t bother to appeal as I had other things to do. Few hours later my account was down.<p>Seems that for retaliation the drug network decided to find me out and use their accounts to subvert LinkedIn&#x27;s policy and ensure I can&#x27;t stop their spam. They have new spam up now while my account is gone.<p>No good deed goes unpunished I guess.",
