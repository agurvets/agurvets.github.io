richarlidad,23,35214688,33,"I made a table where you can find out the source&#x2F;location of factory for where health supplements are made. Then, I spent a year reading product labels so you can save time and money when buying supplements. This is that update.<p>This is still a work in progress but it functions fine.<p>My previous post was a simple database of company data showing ingredient sourcing&#x2F;location. That took 10 days, this has taken me close to 9 months. BackOfLabel is an extension of that initial interest with dosage information at the product &amp; ingredient level.<p>This update allows sorting by many more attributes at the product level (for 4000+ products at the moment) of manually scraped data.<p>Now, for instance you can sort by specific types of ingredient - eg. filter by magnesium glycinate , magnesium orotate or any combination. eg. find ubiquinol or ubiquinone, two forms of coenzyme q10. This is useful for consumers but also companies seeking competitor analysis.<p>You are able to filter products by<p>– Ingredient
– Filter by liquid, tablet, capsule, powder &amp; more
– Browse by UPC Code
– Dosage Information
– No. Individual Serving
– No. Manufacturer Serving
– Total Dosage<p>For example You can also search by type of protein powder - eg. search for whey protein powder and find the dosage information for many products instantly.<p>It frustrates me and I think the way that people buy supplements is wrong. And they don&#x27;t know any better because there are incentive structures that keep them in the dark. This is a small effort to combat the misleading labeling and lack of regulation in the industry.<p>full disclosure - i&#x27;ve provided a generic affiliate link in the table that means i earn a small percentage (5%) of total cart if you purchase through the link<p>note: browse on desktop to filter &amp; sort",1679185919,Show HN: I want to change how people buy health supplements,story,https://www.backoflabel.com/,backoflabel.com

I&#x27;ve done a few classes back in the day at Uni but I was thinking books for a general audience, there&#x27;s stacks for maths and physics (e.g. Godel, Escher, Bach) are there the same for chemistry? not my field and would like to read some.<p>Edit: e.g. a layman&#x27;s summary of &#x27;Analysis, Synthesis, and Design of Chemical Processes&#x27;  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Analysis-Synthesis-Design-Chemical-Processes-ebook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B07DPTVPPF<p>or this &#x27;Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering&#x27;
