benrutter,25,34557775,48,1674916101,Show HN: Clamshell- an experimental Python based shell,story,https://github.com/benrutter/clamshell,"About a month ago I started a suprisingly-not-that tricky project to build an experimental python repl that I could use instead of bash as a daily shell in windows, mac or linux. It&quot;s more hack-for-exploration than a production ready shell, but here it is! Hope somebody finds it anywhere near as interesting to check out as I found making it.<p>Disclaimer: I know about xonsh and love it (if you haven&#x27;t heard of it, google it). This project is more pure python and less python and bash interacting - see the readme for more details.",github.com
