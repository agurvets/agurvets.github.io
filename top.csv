darwinian,27,25853298,39,1611185370,Ask HN: Would anyone be interested in a Hacker News for biology?,story,,"I have a life science and computer science background. Given the increasing interest in biotechnology, synthetic biology, and life extension research on this site, I am considering building out a hacker news style discussion board for biology, with an emphasis on biotechnology and bioengineering.<p>I have noticed a lot of discussions related to life science topics on HN tend to be overly speculative, poorly grounded in empirical research, or simply pseudoscientific. The level of biochemical knowledge here is rather inconsistent compared to say, CS or physics. Most of the time the conversation is merely parroting existing popular science buzzwords, with no real understanding of scale, difficulty, or time to market. I hope by making a new platform that is life science focused rather than on software (yes I am aware HN isn&#x27;t exclusively for software discussions only), there can be greater agglomeration effects for biotechnology research, akin to what hacker news have done for promoting internet startups.",
