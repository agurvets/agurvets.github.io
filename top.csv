qntty,12,34448353,22,1674180616,Ask HN: How do you keep track of your medical history?,story,,"We&#x27;ve all had to fill out forms that ask about our medical history. As I age, I realize that remembering the specifics is getting increasingly hard. I have a bunch of hints about the miscellaneous appointments I&#x27;ve made scattered around 10 different digital health record systems. I can sometimes piece together a good enough history with a little effort, but it would be good to have a personal, secure place to store all the names, appointments, procedure names, and maybe even imaging.<p>Does anybody have a solution better than racking your brain or emacs org mode (which would be an improvement for me)? It looks like 1Password has some basic functionality for this, but I haven&#x27;t used it yet. What&#x27;s your approach to solving this problem right now?",
