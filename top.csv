amber_raza,27,46422812,36,1767028621,Show HN: Evidex – AI Clinical Search (RAG over PubMed/OpenAlex and SOAP Notes),story,https://www.getevidex.com,"Hi HN,<p>I’m a solo dev building a clinical search engine to help my wife (a resident physician) and her colleagues.<p>The Problem: Current tools (UpToDate&#x2F;OpenEvidence) are expensive, slow, or increasingly heavy with pharma ads.<p>The Solution: I built Evidex to be a clean, privacy-first alternative. Search Demo (GIF): <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;zoUvINt"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;zoUvINt</a><p>Technical Architecture (Search-Based RAG): Instead of using a traditional pre-indexed vector database (like Pinecone) which can serve stale data, I implemented a Real-time RAG pattern:<p>Orchestrator: A Node.js backend performs &quot;Smart Routing&quot; (regex&#x2F;keyword analysis) on the query to decide which external APIs to hit (PubMed, Europe PMC, OpenAlex, or ClinicalTrials.gov).<p>Retrieval: It executes parallel fetches to these APIs at runtime to grab the top ~15 abstracts.<p>Local Data: Clinical guidelines are stored locally in SQLite and retrieved via full-text search (FTS) ensuring exact matches on medical terminology.<p>Inference: I’m using Gemini 2.5 Flash to process the concatenated abstracts. The massive context window allows me to feed it distinct search results and force strict citation mapping without latency bottlenecks.<p>Workflow Tools (The &quot;Integration&quot;): I also built a &quot;reasoning layer&quot; to handle complex patient histories (Case Mode) and draft documentation (SOAP Notes). Case Mode Demo (GIF): <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;h01Zgkx"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;h01Zgkx</a> Note Gen Demo (GIF): <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;DI1S2Y0"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;DI1S2Y0</a><p>Why no Vector DB? In medicine, &quot;freshness&quot; is critical. If a new trial drops today, a pre-indexed vector store might miss it. My real-time approach ensures the answer includes papers published today.<p>Business Model: The clinical search is free. I plan to monetize by selling billing automation tools to hospital admins later.<p>Feedback Request: I’d love feedback on the retrieval latency (fetching live APIs is slower than vector lookups) and the accuracy of the synthesized answers.",getevidex.com

brinedew,20,46363870,87,1766482837,Show HN: GeneGuessr – a daily biology web puzzle,story,https://geneguessr.brinedew.bio/,"I made a web game inspired by Geoguessr and Wordle, where you get shown a 3D model of a random human protein each day, and you have to triangulate its gene name using similarity clues.<p>My background is in wet lab molecular biology and I intend this game to be engaging mostly to other biologists. But if you&#x27;re outside the field, I&#x27;m interested to know if you can still solve it with browser use LLMs, and if you learned something interesting doing so. Let me know what you think.<p>I made it with Claude over the last 2 months. My coding experience is limited to basic python data analysis and figure making. I&#x27;ve seen people online asking, &quot;Now that we have coding AI, why isn&#x27;t there a deluge of awesome AI-generated apps made by non-coders?&quot; - if this sounds like you, check out Geneguessr to understand what a web app by a non-coder looks like.<p>I might write more about the process if there&#x27;s a demand, but what really unlocked the project for Claude was Linear MCP, where it could put each individual issue on a shared Kanban board. This, and Playwright MCP for testing on live site, were the two workhorses that got me through this. For bugs Claude couldn&#x27;t one-shot, Linear was great for consolidating issue information so that I could dump it into ChatGPT Codex - it would usually think for like half an hour, output very confusing explanations, but the bug was gone.<p>Game is free, no log-in required, sorry if you run into any mobile bugs - didn&#x27;t test it much there.<p><a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;geneguessr.brinedew.bio&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;geneguessr.brinedew.bio&#x2F;</a>",geneguessr.brinedew.bio
