kevin_vanilla,28,33216663,20,1665854394,Ask HN: Performance psychology in the workplace?,story,,"Hi all,<p>I&#x27;ve been a SWE&#x2F;Research Engineer for a decade or so, but I come from a sports background* and I would like to carry over the gratifying elements of that world to my day job. This includes things like optimizing sleep and nutrition, deliberate practice, mindfulness, and more. In the end, it&#x27;s about pushing yourself to be the best &lt;something&gt; you can be, in the same way athletes push themselves.<p>My question is: are there others who have similar attitudes towards their jobs? What is the best way to connect with them, e.g. is there an existing community here or on Reddit? If not, is there enough interest that I could create one?<p>Thank you!<p>*not professional, but Division 1 and then semi-professional. Good enough to be dedicated, not good enough to be impressive :)<p>PS: I want to make clear that this includes working in a healthy, sustainable way. I&#x27;m not pushing for rise-and-grind or hustle culture.",
