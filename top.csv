sim04ful,23,44144451,70,1748701258,Show HN: Fontofweb – Discover Fonts Used on a Website or Websites Using Font(s),story,https://fontofweb.com,"Hey HN,
I&#x27;ve been working on fontofweb.com on and off for the past 4 years, and I&#x27;m keen to share it with you. It lets you type in the URL of any website and see exactly how the fonts are used: all the weights, line heights, and sizes.<p>A big plus is that it doesn&#x27;t require a Chrome extension, unlike a lot of other tools in this space.<p>You can also search for a specific font and find websites using it. For example, check out sites using Inter: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fontofweb.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;inter"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fontofweb.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;inter</a>. This reverse font search even supports looking for multiple fonts at once, like here’s an example with Inter and Space Mono: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fontofweb.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;inter&#x2F;space-mono"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fontofweb.com&#x2F;w&#x2F;inter&#x2F;space-mono</a>.<p>My goal with Font of Web is to build up a comprehensive database of font usage across the web. By collecting and analyzing this data, I believe we can uncover some valuable trends, such as:<p>* Common font pairings * Popular heading fonts over time * Market share of commercial fonts * Top font foundries based on actual usage<p>I originally built a version of this four years ago and was surprised by how much organic interest it received.<p>I’ve now rebuilt the tool from scratch, moving away from browserless.io — which was quite expensive — to an invisible iframe approach with a proxied URL to handle CORS (it’s a straightforward solution, and I’m rather surprised it isn’t discussed more often). This change has completely eliminated all costs related to web scraping.<p>Here&#x27;s the Tech Stack:<p>* Remix + HeroUI + Tailwind * Rust Backend in Axum * Authentication with OTP email and Google social auth (via openidconnect) * Sqlite running on the same VPS as the API service * $5&#x2F;mo VPS * Cloudflare CDN * Cloudflare R2 for storage * Zeptomail for emails (very cheap and reliable, highly recommend!) * Simple Analytics: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dashboard.simpleanalytics.com&#x2F;fontofweb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dashboard.simpleanalytics.com&#x2F;fontofweb.com</a> * Logging: Journalctl :)<p>There are currently 275 websites in the database, and I&#x27;m working on increasing this. Stats are available at: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.fontofweb.com&#x2F;stats"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.fontofweb.com&#x2F;stats</a>.<p>While the main site doesn&#x27;t need an extension, for more robust searching and to help with Cloudflare-protected sites, there’s a chrome extension available.<p>There&#x27;s also a public API for domains that have already been checked. For instance: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.fontofweb.com&#x2F;report?domain=apple.com&amp;path=&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.fontofweb.com&#x2F;report?domain=apple.com&amp;path=&#x2F;</a>.<p>There&#x27;s also RSS feed I’ve got no idea why you would need this directly, but I&#x27;m using it because Pinterest allows you to automatically populate boards with an RSS. <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.fontofweb.com&#x2F;rss"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.fontofweb.com&#x2F;rss</a><p>Appreciate your thoughts and feedback",fontofweb.com
