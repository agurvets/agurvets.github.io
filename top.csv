_neil,47,44661673,198,1753291403,Show HN: Apple Health MCP Server,story,https://github.com/neiltron/apple-health-mcp,"Hey HN,<p>This is an MCP server to chat with Apple Health data. I built it because I&#x27;m working on (yet another) personal trainer tool that keeps track of my workout goals, etc. and does scheduling for me. Part of that is weekly check-ins. I thought pairing those check-ins with sensor data could be useful, so here we are.<p>It seems there isn&#x27;t a way to automate access to Apple Health data, so this relies on an iOS app that can quickly&#x2F;easily export key data to CSV. So the process at the moment is to export the data every Sunday before doing a check-in. More steps than I&#x27;d like, but in practice isn&#x27;t a big lift.<p>Under the hood this is mostly a thin wrapper around duckdb.<p>There&#x27;s a video of it in action here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;realtron&#x2F;status&#x2F;1947710791521591514"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;realtron&#x2F;status&#x2F;1947710791521591514</a>",github.com

The tool features interactive network visualization powered by Cytoscape.js, with real-time graph editing and manipulation capabilities. It supports JSON import&#x2F;export and provides a responsive design that works seamlessly on the desktop (mobile-friendly version coming later).<p>The tech stack combines modern frontend technologies with robust backend architecture. The frontend uses Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Cytoscape.js for the visualization engine. The backend is built with FastAPI and Python.<p>The featured demo showcases a Traumatic Brain Injury Nasal Spray mechanism of action visualization, demonstrating the tool&#x27;s capability to handle complex biological pathway mapping.<p>You can explore the live demo at &lt;<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodes.bio"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodes.bio</a>&gt; to see the TBI Nasal Spray visualization in action, along with other biological network examples.<p>I&#x27;d love feedback on the visualization capabilities or any suggestions for biological data integration.
