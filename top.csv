I feel that I should be resting instead, but I need to work.<p>So I use food as a performance enhancing drug. I gobble up chicken wings, veggies, chocolate, peanut butter sandwiches, milk, fruit, Sprite Zero - lots of it - and all of a sudden I can work again.<p>Does anyone else feel this or go through something similar? Do you think it&#x27;s healthy? Is there any alternative? It definitely screws up my diet.",
