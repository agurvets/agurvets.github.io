I made Peerdiem (a portmanteau word between Peer and Per Diem, which means Per Day in latin).
The idea is very simple, a new painting or artwork to discover and discuss with your peers every day.<p>Content is currently only fetched from Chicago Art Institute Free API [1] but I&#x27;m planning to add more sources in the short future.<p>It was built with a couple of technologies I wanted to try for some time. Frontend is made with Preact and styled with Tailwindcss. Backend consists of an FastAPI app deployed in a Docker container.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.artic.edu&#x2F;open-access&#x2F;public-api"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.artic.edu&#x2F;open-access&#x2F;public-api</a>",peerdiem.com

techsin101,41,32272803,19,1659064998,Tell HN: Food is too expensive now,story,,"Groceries are expensive but eating out has now become very expensive, I find myself almost not getting any take outs or eating at restaurants. Maybe once every quarter. And When I do eat out I&#x27;m always annoyed how not only prices are almost 2x, but actually it&#x27;s less and taste crap compared to just 2 years ago. Imagine your favorite food spot of 10+ years suddenly trash and expensive.<p>This has objectively lowered quality of my life, I don&#x27;t really buy any electronics, my phone is 6+ years old, and computer is 5 years old. I like to buy to simplest clothes in bulk 10 for $X. Because happiness from stuff just isn&#x27;t there for me, I&#x27;d rather get quiet time at beach and watch sunset with a friend, or engage in intellectual debate. So food was only thing I enjoyed getting. Now it cost $170+ for family portion, and $25+ at cheapest place for 1.<p>Sure It&#x27;s affordable for me at my tech salary, but I&#x27;m not going to be spending more on food than rent. Is there hope on the horizon? why wont&#x27; govt do something to bring prices down, bring deflation.",
