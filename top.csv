firechickenbird,15,34963062,15,1677537844,Ask HN: Is this Generative AI hype healthy?,story,,"With the rising Generative AI hype, I&#x27;m starting to feel totally overwhelmed. I&#x27;m a tech person and I&#x27;ve always enjoyed tech stuff and innovation. But seriously, with the recent advances in Generative AI, and especially with the absurd proliferation of AI apps that are simple modifications of GPT3&#x2F;ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion, I&#x27;m worried about the consequences that it will have on humanity. Nowadays, whenever I see new content online, the first thing that I think about is whether it was created by an AI or a Human. And with all these new AI tools popping around, the Generative bulls*t is expanding even to my emails and my personal&#x2F;work chats. I feel like I&#x27;m suffocating from all this fakeness. Is anybody else in a similar situation? What do you think about this Generative AI hype?",
