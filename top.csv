johnrushx,41,39459268,60,1708548236,Show HN: An Experiment with One-Feature Tool Made $7164/Mo,story,,"My Raw Story on coming up with an idea, building and growing it. It&#x27;s very detailed, with the purpose of giving another founder an insider look at one way of doing it.<p>In January I launched an indexing tool called Index Rusher, that forces google to index your pages quicker, to get ranked for SEO faster. This whole project was something I needed myself since I got over 20 products and paying for an external one would simply cost too much.<p>My initial idea was that I would just build an internal tool for my use, that has only 1 feature. No UI really, just 1 button.<p>In the middle of the process, I realized that I could actually run an experiment and launch this tool publically with just one feature. Super simple.<p>I hired a dev who spent a month building it. It looked super easy at first, but it turned out there were so many hidden snakes on the way. Troubles with sitemaps, google APIs, and more.<p>1 month later I launched it (In Jan). The launch didn&#x27;t go so great, but I didn&#x27;t really have high hopes. Because nobody knew about this tool, I had no traffic on the site. I still sold several licenses, which made me pretty happy, it felt like validation, people needed it, even if it solved such a narrow problem.<p>At that point, I declared my next stage of the experiment: Growing the traffic and revenue.<p>I&#x27;ve done a number of growth hacks in the next 30 days, resulting in over $7k in revenue, but what&#x27;s more important, the traffic on the site has grown a lot and stays high and growing. This means I&#x27;ve done a pretty good job on organic growth too, which will just accelerate over time.<p>Here is what I&#x27;ve done:<p>Cross-linking. 
I added links in the footer on my other products. This is one hidden effect of having multiple products. Each may serve as a lead magnet for the other one. In my case, I have the same audience for all my tools, people who love one of my tools often check out the rest.<p>Being visible on social media. 
I monitor discussions around the Google Indexing topics and add my replies there. I don&#x27;t just spam in replies with my tools, in most cases, I genuinely answer and bring value. If my reply gets a reply, I may include my URL in the next reply.<p>Social Media and Blog posts. 
I&#x27;ve posted several posts about Growth, where I mentioned Indexrusher since I actually use it for me Growth.<p>Traffic from Directories. 
This one was the top channel of growth. Over 50% of the paying users arrive from web directories. I used a tool that listed Index Rusher on 100 directories &amp; websites.<p>Sponsored listings. 
I &quot;sponsored&quot; directories to place a banner for my tool on the top of their page&#x2F;list. Seeing the effect of &quot;boosted&quot; listings. The ROI was good. About $2.5k of revenue came in from these boosts.<p>Affiliate partners
Made a deal with a few affiliate partners who reached out to me on X and he drove a decent amount of traffic and paid users to me since he was launching on PH the same week,<p>The total economy of the project now
Dev costs: $1500*3=$4500<p>- Godaddy domain: $9<p>- hetzner Hosting: $10&#x2F;mo<p>- landing page on Unicorn Platform: $9&#x2F;mo<p>- cost of sponsorships: $800<p>- Affiliate payouts: $150<p>- listingbott for backlinks: $499<p>- seobot ai for blog: $99<p>- Stripe fees: $654<p>Total cost: $6711<p>Revenue: $7164<p>Profit: $453.<p>So, it&#x27;s profitable!<p>My next steps will be
1) Promote it to 100,000+ users of my Website Builder and reach out to more website builders and pitch them the integration<p>2) Increase Word-of-mouth effect<p>3) Perhaps try some paid ads<p>4) Add automated emails to remind about Index Rusher users who signed up but didn&#x27;t buy<p>5) Launch a directory as a lead magnet<p>6) Launch little free tools as lead magnets<p>7) Product Hunt launch<p>8) AppSumo launch<p>I will make a new post in a month describing how it went.",
