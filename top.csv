broken_clock,11,37557545,38,1695050921,Show HN: A murder mystery game built on an open-source gen-AI agent framework,story,https://www.gron.games/,"Hey HN,<p>Michael and Scott here. We’re open-sourcing an interactive murder mystery featuring LLM-driven character agents. Solve the mystery by finding clues, taking notes, and interrogating agents. They all have distinct motives, personality, and can impact the game in different ways (attacking you, running away, etc). Try it out, it’s pretty fun!<p>We’re also open-sourcing the framework that we used to make and refine the agents. The goal is to create an intuitive interface for storytellers to create, debug, and test game agents. We then take those game agents and expose an API beyond just chat - such as actions, player guardrails, emotional queries, etc.<p>We’re not done yet - there are a lot more features coming on the way: scenario-based agent evals, agent-storyline consistency management, automatic agent generation, etc.<p>We would love to hear your feedback.<p>Thanks!<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mluogh&#x2F;grontown"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mluogh&#x2F;grontown</a><p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mluogh&#x2F;eastworld"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mluogh&#x2F;eastworld</a><p>[2] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;qRaWE2jp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;qRaWE2jp</a>",gron.games
