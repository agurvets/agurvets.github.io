annie_muss,9,33004134,12,1664337933,Ask HN: Explaining many short tenures due to poor mental health,story,,I&#x27;m job hunting as a software engineer but I am having trouble getting interviews. I am mid 30&#x27;s and have been working in software since 2014.  In my past 6 jobs I have averaged tenures of around 6 months. I&#x27;m working with a mental health professional to improve my coping skills in relation to anxiety and ADHD.<p>This situation is not ideal. On a resume so many short stints is a real red flag and I don&#x27;t know how to explain them.  I feel a junior&#x2F;mid job in a supportive team would allow me to grow the most at this point in my career but I don&#x27;t know how to get my foot in the door.<p>How do other people explain many short stints on a resume?  How can I put them in the most positive light possible?,
