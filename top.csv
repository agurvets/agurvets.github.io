jamez,61,35572434,238,1681494530,Show HN: WikiBinge – discover how all things are vaguely connected,story,https://www.wikibinge.com/,"Connect two articles on Wikipedia, but do it the long way. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the theory of six degree of separation, but it&#x27;s an overused concept when exploring the Wiki-graph.<p>Instead of showing the shortest path, which in my opinion is &quot;boring&quot; and ends up connecting super-important central articles, I came up with my own method: WikiBinge selects the smaller, less represented articles on Wikipedia. In a WikiBinge path, the underdogs are the kings!<p>How does it work? It&#x27;s pretty straightforward! Compute PageRank on the Wiki-graph and assign as weight of each edge the PageRank value of the destination node. A WikiBinge path is then simply a shortest path using these weights: the algorithm will then favor paths passing through articles with lower PageRank values.<p>More on the motives to build this here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jamez.it&#x2F;project&#x2F;wikibinge&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jamez.it&#x2F;project&#x2F;wikibinge&#x2F;</a><p>This is an older project of mine, but it never got much exposure, so I&#x27;m humbly submitting it now.",wikibinge.com
