Some of these might be recorded via apps (e.g. Apple Health) others would be manually put in (e.g. blood work sheet from my doctor).<p>I&#x27;ve looked around and didn&#x27;t really find any platform like this. Some options were very much geared towards the U.S. market and provided connections to health care providers. I think, what I am looking for is much more simple than this.<p>So far I&#x27;ve been putting everything in an Excel sheet but I&#x27;m not a big fan of Excel and would like something standalone that might also show me progressions and changes more easily.<p>Any suggestions?",
