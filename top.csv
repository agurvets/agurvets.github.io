- Generate datafile (JSON file) in CI&#x2F;CD workflow and upload to your CDN
- Fetch datafile in your application runtime and consume with SDKs<p>Supports:<p>- Feature flags: boolean flags
- Experimentation: a&#x2F;b tests
- Segments: targeting traffic with conditions
- Variables: namespaced under each feature and conditional
- Gradual rollouts: avoid big bang releases, go from 0% to 100%
- Consistent bucketing: same user sees same variation
- Multiple environments: prod, staging, test, and more
- Force bucketing: allow testers to force enable&#x2F;disable for themselves only
- Tagging: resulting in smaller datafiles for your application(s)
- Tracking: integration with any analytics tool
- Status site generator: for human friendly status reporting
- SDKs: for Node.js and browser environments, Kotlin&#x2F;Swift planned for future",featurevisor.com
