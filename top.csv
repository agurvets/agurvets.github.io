Fischgericht,12,39545116,30,1709165160,Why is Facebook unable to stop a wave of trojan infections through Facebook ads?,story,,"I am currently getting my Facebook feed flooded with &quot;ads&quot; that claim to be coming from OpenAI and&#x2F;or Midjourney. These &quot;ads&quot; claim to be containing a &quot;private release&quot; of their new AI technology (Sora and others), and asks the user to follow a link.<p>That link directly goes to a Google Drive, containing a single RAR file, containing an &quot;Installer&quot;. Of course the installer really is a trojan infecting your PC.<p>How on earth can Facebook be unable to filter this? How can it even be possible to post an ad with Facebook containing a Link to a Google Drive? Don&#x27;t they do ANY validation of ownership of link targets? On Google Ads for example you can not link to any Domain you haven&#x27;t proven ownership for.<p>This is not rocket science. I am not even asking Facebook to run a virus scanner on link targets. But how about disallowing links to Google Drives, or direct links to downloads in general?<p>Also, how is it possible that Facebook does not do ANY checks on registered trademarks when &quot;advertisers&quot; create accounts? How is it possible that scammers can create account names like &quot;Amazon&quot;, &quot;OpenAI&quot; etc? How hard can it be to look up account names in a database of registered brand names?<p>Just today I have reported five of those &quot;ads&quot; to Facebook, but they keep popping up.<p>I am flabbergasted that it is SO easy to abuse Facebook to mass-infect users.<p>Does anyone have any contact to alert anyone with competence at Facebook? Just reporting those ads one by one won&#x27;t change anything.",
