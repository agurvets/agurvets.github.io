marjipan200,21,38499722,64,1701534553,Show HN: ChatCBT – AI-powered cognitive behavioral therapist for Obsidian,story,https://github.com/clairefro/obsidian-chat-cbt-plugin,"ChatCBT is an AI-powered cognitive behavioral therapist for your local Obsidian notes.<p>You have the choice to use OpenAI, or a 100% local model with Ollama for total data privacy.<p>When you&#x27;re done with your conversation, ChatCBT can automatically summarize the chat into a table listing your negative beliefs, emotions, categories of negative thinking, and reframed thoughts. This way you can start to recognize patterns in your thinking and begin to rewire your reactions to disturbing circumstances.<p>Conversations are stored in markdown files on your local machine, ensuring privacy and portability while giving you the freedom to organize your sessions as you please. You could easily share these files with a therapist.<p>I built this for myself when I noticed the patterns of chat help I was getting from my therapist in between therapy sessions was essentially coaching that didn&#x27;t require much context beyond the immediate situation and emotions. This felt like a particularly good use case for LLMs.<p>ChatCBT has been pretty effective for me to talk myself through spiraling episodes of negative thinking. I&#x27;ve been able to get back on my horse faster, and it&#x27;s convenient that it&#x27;s available 24&#x2F;7 and 5000x cheaper than a therapy session (or free if using Ollama). That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d like to share it - curious if it helps anyone else.<p>It&#x27;s under review to become an Obsidian community plugin, but in the meantime it&#x27;s available now via git clone (see readme). Happy for feedback",github.com
