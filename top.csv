phowson83,56,28168336,92,1628859790,Launch HN: Iona Mind (YC S21) – App-based cognitive behavioural therapy,story,,"Hi HN, we’re Iona Mind. We provide app-based mental health support, with a focus on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT).<p>Mental healthcare is difficult for many people to access, whether because of cost, stigma or waiting times. According to a recent pre-covid study in England [1] 18% of people are experiencing a mental health issue, yet only 5% actually access help through an employer’s assistance plan (if one even exists) [2] . The majority suffer in silence. In addition to the human cost, there are significant economic costs. In the U.S., mental health issues cost employers thousands of dollars per employee per year in medical costs and lost productivity [3].<p>At our previous company, we lost a colleague to suicide. Since then we’ve been on a mission to bring evidence-based mental healthcare to as many people as possible. We were surprised to find that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is backed by over 30 years of research, and over 250 meta-analyses [4], yet remains difficult for people to access. CBT has been shown to be effective for a wide range of mental health conditions, even when administered digitally [5] or in books (so called bibliotherapy) [6]. While we do not believe that self or app administered CBT can replace the human touch, it does provide a convenient, affordable, always accessible and stigma-free way for many users to access support, when they may not have been able or ready to seek it in person. In the UK, the NHS presents a progressive “stepped model” of mental healthcare, depending upon severity from step 1 to step 4. We see apps playing a part in step 1, step 1a and possibly step 2 of this model [7].<p>While there are a number of CBT apps available, we wanted to base ours around Low-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, a relatively new variant which has been used extensively in England to treat people with mild to moderate conditions at scale. In low-intensity CBT, the patient more or less treats themselves by doing exercises, and the therapist supports the process. This approach to CBT is especially suited to delivery through a digital form. Our clinical director, Professor Paul Farrand, was the architect of using Low-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural therapy at scale in the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), and the editor of one of the first international textbooks on the subject [8].<p>Our app presents the user with a chatbot which guides them through CBT techniques and exercises. We went for a chat-style UI to make the software more engaging—it’s a challenge to make an app of this kind be more than just a “content board”. Our chatbot engine is graph-based. At some nodes in the graph, classifiers applied to the user’s free text entry determine the path through this graph, along with the user’s state and past inputs. We want the paths within the app to be predictable and ensure that the chatbot doesn’t do anything unexpected. We’d seen more freeform generative seq2seq style chatbots produce potentially dangerous output at times in other apps and wanted to avoid this. Also, CBT has been shown to often work better when “therapist drift” is minimized—this is where the therapist drifts away from the prescribed structure of the exercises in CBT [9]. A graph-based conversation is a good way to keep things on track.<p>We offer the app as an employee wellness benefit to organizations. Since only 5% of employees tend to use the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) at their employer, the app offers a way to support the “missing middle” for whom mindfulness&#x2F;meditation apps are not sufficient, but who aren’t ready to access their employer’s EAP. We offer use of the app completely anonymously if the user wishes.

codypilot,33,28168813,70,1628862701,Launch HN: FirstIgnite (YC S21) – Matching scientists with relevant businesses,story,,"Hi, HN! I’m Cody Pawlowski and my co-founder is Chase Bonhag and we’re FirstIgnite (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstignite.com&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;firstignite.com&#x2F;</a>). We help researchers at universities connect with companies interested in funding or licensing their research.<p>Currently, a vast majority of all research goes uncommercialized. This includes everything from new cancer therapies to energy storage improvements and other solutions to universal problems. By connecting research to relevant companies, we increase the probability that research will be commercialized.<p>We met while I was running a natural language processing startup at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Chase was working at Illinois Ventures, the venture capital arm of the university. U of I conducted over $900M a year worth of research, much of which was going uncommercialized.  Because university research portfolios are massive, diverse, and highly complex, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to figure out which companies to partner with for which research. We realized that we could apply NLP to the problem because it was written in scientific text via patents and publications!<p>We started by taking unpaid pilots from universities in fall of 2019. Seven schools gave us two pieces of research to match to industry. For 6 of the schools, we completely failed and were unable to connect any of their research to companies. But for one school, we managed to connect both of their technologies to 5 companies each. We learned that patent databases had company interest and activity in text format that matched well to research publications.  We also learned that matching to patents was not quite enough, but if we also looked at the competitors of those holding patents we were able to identify a large enough top-of-funnel to find success on almost any topic.  We built our initial product and process around that approach.<p>Researchers upload scientific documents describing their research and receive tailored lists of companies interested in that research. Using natural language processing and graph theory, our software analyzes the texts and matches their research to industry activity consisting of nearly 3 billion relationships stored across public and proprietary data.  We’ve had success mainly leveraging USPTO full-text and competitive intelligence data, with plans to bring in European patents, SBIR, clinical trials, job postings, corporate filings, press releases, social media, and any other text that hints at what a corporation is interested in.<p>What’s unusual is that we’re the only solution that allows you to upload a piece of research and receive a tailored list of companies and leads to contact.  We call this active marketing—helping researchers get in touch with those who are most likely to move their research forward—as opposed to a passive marketing approach, where researchers upload their technologies in hopes of companies reaching out to them (of course, they usually don’t). Our approach results in an average of 5 meetings with companies per scientific document vs our competitors&#x27; passive approach which is lucky to result in 1 meeting.  We currently make money by selling software and service subscriptions to universities.<p>Some examples: Professor Chou at the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia uses our tool to identify companies working on cancer therapies and connect with them about potential research partnerships.  Carnegie Mellon University uses our software to market &quot;moonshot&quot; research topics to companies to identify future funding partners. UC Davis uses our tool to identify companies interested in licensing their intellectual property.<p>We’re really excited to share FirstIgnite with this community.  We’re open to all thoughts and ideas, we’d love to learn about experiences you’ve had working on research projects, things you know about university research or corporate R&amp;D, or anything else that can help us.  Thank you!",
