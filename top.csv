Notably, it classifies virtually all software development as research, as well as the proportional share of all overhead&#x2F;fringe expenses. It also changes the treatment of contracted research activities (note that includes software). This has a hugely negative impact for early-stage startups, contract research firms (i.e. SBIR companies), and independent software developers.<p>To construct a basic example:<p><pre><code>  Revenue:  $100k 
  Expenses: $100k (developer salaries)
  Net operating income:  $0
  Taxable income: $100k - 0.1x100k = $90k (first year deduction is 10% of SREs)
</code></pre>
Come tax time, you now owe the government $18-30k taxes on your $0 real income.",
