I&#x27;m struggling a bit with my health. As a software developer all day long, I keep staring on my laptop. Sitting and I&#x27;m so used to this that even on Saturdays, I&#x27;ve (out of habit) open up the laptop and try something out.<p>This is impacting my health.
- I&#x27;ve gained weight.
- I&#x27;ve got nothing else to do.
- I have tried gym but extensive work hours keep messing with my rhythm.<p>The internet advice is from people who aren&#x27;t in the same situation as I am. They say wake up at certain time, eat X Y Z meals. N % protien,  G gms of Sodium etc. 
But I on the other hand need to run builds, do deployments, and fix if anything is broken. I get mentally exhausted by the end of day.<p>How are you able to deal with this? Need help please.",
