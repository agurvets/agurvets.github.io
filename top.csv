capableweb,128,32372351,134,1659826743,Ask HN: More “experimental” UIs for editing/writing code?,story,,"There is a bunch of editors with the traditional model of inserting text with the keyboard, arrows move the cursor around, you click around in menus&#x2F;using hotkeys to perform actions (Visual Studio Code, Atom, Eclipse). Then there is the &quot;modal&quot; editors that have different modes where you can switch between for example &quot;editing&quot; or &quot;movement&quot; modes, and what your keyboard controls depends on the mode you&#x27;re in (editors like Vim). Otherwise there is also very interactive and extensible editors, where eval basically lives within&#x2F;together with the editor (Emacs, LightTable)<p>Otherwise, most editors fit in somewhere along those lines.<p>But what other editors is there out there that have something really different for editing&#x2F;writing code? Things that come to mind is &quot;editors&quot; like Scratch where you aren&#x27;t really &quot;editing&quot; code with your keyboard, but moving things around instead. Or, if I imagine I&#x27;d create a editor for programming controlled by a joystick, what kind of UI and UX would that editor have?",
