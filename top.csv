doomrobo,14,32809593,35,1662988278,Show HN: ReadToMyShoe – An offline-first web app for listening to your articles,story,https://beta.readtomyshoe.com/,"ReadtoMyShoe (RTMS) is a web app that lets you upload articles (via URL or via directly pasting) and listen to them (via text-to-speech) at a later time. Some features:<p>* Offline-first: All the articles in your queue are available offline. RTMS is usable even in airplane mode.<p>* High-quality text-to-speech: RTMS uses the Google Cloud Text to Speech WaveNet voices. It&#x27;s not quite human yet, but it&#x27;s pretty nice.<p>* Saves your progress: Don&#x27;t lose your place in your reading material. RTMS will save where you are. So next time you play an article, it&#x27;ll resume right where you left off.<p>* Lockscreen controls: Play, pause, jump 10 seconds. It&#x27;s all available from the lock screen or notification bar of your mobile device.<p>* Runs anywhere: Since RTMS is a web app, it runs everywhere a (modern) web browser runs.<p>* Add to Homescreen: RTMS can be added to your homescreen and behave just like a native app.<p>&quot;Doesn&#x27;t this exist?&quot; Eh, sorta. I was using Pocket to listen to articles before this, and it was terrible. The UI had (and continues to have) show-stopping bugs, and there are practically never updates for it anymore. There are other apps too, but most of them are native apps, and the only decent ones I could find were also pretty exploitative (lots of pop-ups everywhere, free trials with no pricing info, etc.)<p>Source code: Everything here is open source. Please leave comments, open PRs, open Issues, etc. at <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rozbb&#x2F;readtomyshoe"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rozbb&#x2F;readtomyshoe</a> . The whole thing is in Rust!<p>Finally, a note on this demo site: I can&#x27;t run this site for very long. Google Cloud TTS is $16 per 1M characters. The average news article is like 6.5k characters, so $0.10. That&#x27;s not scalable for me, so I gotta shut down the server after a little bit. I do have a rough plan to scale this though and allow for people to pay for their own TTS though: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rozbb&#x2F;readtomyshoe&#x2F;issues&#x2F;29"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rozbb&#x2F;readtomyshoe&#x2F;issues&#x2F;29</a>",beta.readtomyshoe.com
