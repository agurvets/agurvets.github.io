benrutter,25,34557775,50,1674916101,Show HN: Clamshell- an experimental Python based shell,story,https://github.com/benrutter/clamshell,"About a month ago I started a suprisingly-not-that tricky project to build an experimental python repl that I could use instead of bash as a daily shell in windows, mac or linux.

This project is more pure python and less python and bash interacting - see the readme for more details.",github.com
