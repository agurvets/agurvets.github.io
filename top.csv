Its. A tool I used for sports betting Arbitrage to compute the arbitrage conditions &amp; payouts.<p>The second is Obsidian [2]
This has completely replaced Google Keep as my notes taking app.<p>The third has been Lithium [3].
I currently do 90% of my book reading in this app. The ergonomics of epub copies is just perfect and this is a perfect epub reader.<p>Fourth is Scrivener. [4]
Planning to write by first book with this. It&#x27;s just perfect.<p>Last is Button Down [5]
This allowed me to add a subscription page on my statically hosted blog. And the minimalistic nature of the service made it perfect.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.ajinkyamankar.surebetarbitragecalculator<p>[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsidian.md<p>[3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.faultexception.reader<p>[4]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.literatureandlatte.com&#x2F;scrivener&#x2F;overview<p>[5]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buttondown.email&#x2F;",
