_neil,33,44661673,154,1753291403,Show HN: Apple Health MCP Server,story,https://github.com/neiltron/apple-health-mcp,"Hey HN,<p>This is an MCP server to chat with Apple Health data. I built it because I&#x27;m working on (yet another) personal trainer tool that keeps track of my workout goals, etc. and does scheduling for me. Part of that is weekly check-ins. I thought pairing those check-ins with sensor data could be useful, so here we are.<p>It seems there isn&#x27;t a way to automate access to Apple Health data, so this relies on an iOS app that can quickly&#x2F;easily export key data to CSV. So the process at the moment is to export the data every Sunday before doing a check-in. More steps than I&#x27;d like, but in practice isn&#x27;t a big lift.<p>Under the hood this is mostly a thin wrapper around duckdb.<p>There&#x27;s a video of it in action here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;realtron&#x2F;status&#x2F;1947710791521591514"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;realtron&#x2F;status&#x2F;1947710791521591514</a>",github.com

Lines 900-970 were just cryptic numbers that made no sense to me. Finally figured it out decades later.<p>Turns out it&#x27;s machine learning from the 1970s! The AI learns by literally deleting bad moves from an array. After losing ~10 games, it becomes unbeatable. Just 19 board states, no neural networks, no fancy algorithms.<p>Martin Gardner (who wrote about it) also mentioned MENACE - a tic-tac-toe learning machine made with matchboxes and beads. Same principle, physical implementation.<p>Made a JavaScript version if anyone wants to try. The AI really does get better.",sublevelgames.github.io
