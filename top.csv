I went to an ATProto meetup last week, and as a burnt-out semi-academic who hates academic publishing, I thought there might be a cool opportunity to build on Octopus (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.octopus.ac&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.octopus.ac&#x2F;</a>), so I got a bit excited over the weekend and built Octosphere.<p>Hopefully some of you find it interesting!
