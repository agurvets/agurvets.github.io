I had a browse on Amazon but couldn&#x27;t find any, except a few cooking ones. Things I was thinking - industrial chemistry what the different processes are for things like Oil, Soap, plastics and so on. Same for pharmaceuticals and Molecular biology. I&#x27;ve done a few classes back in the day at Uni but I was thinking books for a general audience, there&#x27;s stacks for maths and physics (e.g. Godel, Escher, Bach) are there the same for chemistry? not my field and would like to read some.<p>Edit: e.g. a layman&#x27;s summary of &#x27;Analysis, Synthesis, and Design of Chemical Processes&#x27;  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Analysis-Synthesis-Design-Chemical-Processes-ebook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B07DPTVPPF<p>or this &#x27;Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering&#x27;
