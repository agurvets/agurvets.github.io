DavidPBL,88,30557288,186,1646413234,Launch HN: Phase Biolabs (YC W22) – Converting CO2 to Carbon-Neutral Chemicals,story,,"Hi HN, I am David Ortega, a bioengineer and founder at Phase Biolabs (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phasebiolabs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.phasebiolabs.com</a>). We’re building technology that uses fermentation to turn CO2 emissions into carbon-neutral chemicals—specifically into sustainable, cost-competitive solvents for the pharma, cosmetics, and paint industries.<p>We’ve built a lab-scale prototype that is a 1.5L bioreactor with a microorganism inside that &#x27;eats&#x27; carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas, converting them into chemicals as it grows. Here&#x27;s a demo video I just made for HN: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RUIT3RUeUPE"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RUIT3RUeUPE</a>. We are currently making ethanol in the lab but unfortunately CO2-based ethanol cannot be legally sold as a beverage, so industrial solvents it is :)<p>You can do two things with carbon: you can capture it, or you can use it. Both are hard, but the latter is harder, mainly because carbon dioxide is so small.<p>Capturing CO2 is usually done by attaching it to something else, usually another molecule, which is how we can extract it from a dilute gas stream or &#x27;pull it&#x27; out of the air. But the CO2 molecule is only temporarily transformed.<p>Using CO2 is a different ball game, usually referred to as CCU (carbon capture and utilization). For this you need to permanently convert the molecular structure itself, and since you are working with extremely tiny pieces of matter, you need extremely precise machinery.<p>The challenge with converting CO2 is doing it efficiently. It needs to happen with as little energy as possible and to be as precise as possible. If you want to convert CO2 into X, but you also produce Y, and Z, that is a problem which will show up in the cost. Our solution is bio-based CCU, but there are also electrochemical and thermochemical technologies, each with advantages and disadvantages. And there are other bio-based approaches, such as making trees more efficient (e.g. Living Carbon W20). All are valid strategies.<p>In biology, CCU is known as carbon fixation. During my PhD I was engineering microbes to convert wastes into renewable chemicals and fuels, so I began to study biochemical carbon pathways, which led me to carbon fixation. I began to realize how important carbon fixation is at a macro level (carbon cycle) and how the process works, but also that it is extremely inefficient and can be optimized. For example, the trees in your garden don’t grow very fast. This is due to photosynthesis being 2-4% efficient. I’ve always wanted to start a startup and that has always been in the back of my mind, so I did things that I enjoyed that could also help towards reaching that goal, which led me to this.<p>Advances in synthetic biology mean we can do things that weren&#x27;t possible 20-30 years ago. The amount of tinkering that we can do has substantially increased (and costs have dropped), and our understanding has grown due to a rise in data and analytics. We can borrow strategies that have worked in the past in other fields and apply them in new ways.<p>Since biological carbon fixation is precise, but very inefficient, our approach is to take that precision and enhance it using synthetic biology into a process that is efficient, scalable, and productive enough for industrial application. We&#x27;re using microorganisms that can naturally fix carbon, and transforming them into mini factories. Our microorganisms are 7x more energy efficient than naturally occurring plants or algae and in theory can produce almost any molecule found in nature directly from CO2.<p>Carbon fixation is catalysed by a carbon fixation (biochemical) pathway, which is simply a set of enzymes that catalyse a sequence of steps&#x2F;reactions. The enzymes attach electrons and hydrogen ions onto the CO2 molecule, while removing the oxygen, one step at a time. This process can be called reverse combustion, but whereas combustion is uncontrolled and explosive (literally), carbon fixation is highly controlled. It’s a stepwise progression from a single CO2 molecule, adding hydrogen&#x2F;electrons one at a time and eventually carbon (going from 1C -&gt; 2C, then 3C etc.) to get to your target product. Enzymes are the perfect molecular machines for this as precision is their speciality.<p>Our plan is to initially sell our technology to CO2 emitters so that they can reduce emissions and make money by converting a problem&#x2F;cost (emissions) into new revenue. The technology scales to the size of the emitter. The cost is very different for a company that emits 50,000 tons per year vs 500,000 tons per year. We have some early estimates based on some economic modelling we’ve done.<p>We are at an early stage and have a long way to go but we have big ambitions for using CCU technology to decarbonise heavy industry, make sustainable chemicals and transition towards a circular economy.<p>Fermentation processes are well understood, easily scalable and easy to operate. We think gas fermentation can be easily deployed around the world to convert&#x2F;recycle CO2 into sustainable products and Phase is aiming to use it to recycle emissions on the gigaton scale by 2040.<p>I hope this short summary provides new or renewed interest in the age-old process of fermentation, something that has been with us for millennia (my family has been making homemade wine for many years). I&#x27;d love to discuss any of these topics with you!",

siersciu,4,30558020,16,1646416561,Show HN: Mailwitness – Digital Signatures over Email,story,https://mailwitness.com,"Hi HN,
I&#x27;m Marek Dopiera and I wanted to share the digital signature solution which I made with my software house. Your feedback would be much appreciated.<p>We&#x27;ve just launched it - it&#x27;s a service for signing documents over e-mail - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailwitness.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailwitness.com</a>. It still has some rough edges, but hopefully it is useful already.<p>To sign a PDF with somebody, you e-mail them the PDF and put sign@mailwitness.com in CC. If they agree, they need to forward it to sign@mailwitness.com. When they do, you all get your document signed. You can generate PDFs from e-mail, too for convenience.<p>We made this to raise the safety bar of agreements made via e-mail. Via anecdotal evidence, we know that if people do not use services like DocuSign or HelloSign, they consider an e-mail conversation as proof or they print, sign and scan documents. I think we&#x27;re offering more safety and convenience, because we&#x27;re preventing the documents from alteration, forging fakes and backdating (by using OpenTimestamp, which essentially constructs a Merkle tree and puts its root into a Bitcoin transaction).<p>I&#x27;m hoping that our service becomes useful also because it doesn&#x27;t require any sign-up (just one confirmation e-mail for Ts&amp;Cs), it&#x27;s free (in the basic model) and doesn&#x27;t require the extra cognitive load on learning a web app or a mobile app.<p>You may argue, that one can create a fake e-mail account and use that. That&#x27;s a valid point, but the reality proves that verification via e-mail is enough for lots of people (vide the agreements over e-mail or DocuSign or HelloSign). In the future we may create paid options, which would include extra identity verification. Even without that extra option, things are not as bad, though: if you use your work e-mail, it&#x27;s usually your employer who verified your identity.<p>Another question you might have is spoofing. If your e-mail has a valid DKIM signature (which is the case for most major e-mail providers), we&#x27;ll accept your message. If it doesn&#x27;t we&#x27;ll send you a message to verify that you can also receive e-mail.<p>For data safety, we have designed the service such that we discard the documents as soon as we process an e-mail (usually a low number of seconds).<p>Finally, there is legal safety. We operate under the EU law, which qualifies us as a &quot;Trust service provider&quot; and puts requirements on our service. What we do, qualifies as an &quot;Advanced Digital Signature&quot; and according to the EU law, cannot be denied legal effect based on the grounds that it is digital.<p>Monetization path is unclear yet - I want to see if this catches on and if yes, how people are going to use it. Some options include extra services like using your own certificate rather than ours or identity verification.<p>I would really love to hear your feedback - especially for what reasons you would not use it.<p>Thank you",mailwitness.com
