rafiki6,36,26038182,17,1612543263,Ask HN: How Does a Canadian SWE/Data Scientist Make a Move to the US?,story,,"I&#x27;ve tried now and failed multiple times to make this move over my career. Primarily been interviewing with Tier 1 companies and not getting through, so I figure might make sense to try to get the attention of the Tier 2&#x27;s to at least get into the market, but none have really reached out or accepted my applications.<p>Despite what the media wants you to think, Canada is not a good place to grow in IT and Software and ML. Best jobs here are being a part of a remote office for a FAANG or going to work for a Bank, or even just remote jobs for US companies since they&#x27;ll pay you in USD which will mean you get an automatic 30% pay increase.<p>Pay is 2-3x less than the US, and CoL is about the same (especially if you want to buy something with a somewhat commutable distance to the major metros).<p>So my question to those who have successfully left later in their career (7-10 YOE), how did you manage it? What companies paid the most attention to you? What did your experience look like and how did you promote yourself if you weren&#x27;t part of some hot startup like Shopify?<p>NOTE: I&#x27;m not here to argue the merits of the Canadian tech market. If you like it here, kudos to you and hope you find good growth opportunities.",
