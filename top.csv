ar7hur,136,35151881,117,1678803381,Show HN: Using GPT-3 and Whisper to save doctors’ time,story,,"Hey HN,<p>We&#x27;re Alex, Martin and Laurent. We previously founded Wit.ai (W14), which we sold to Facebook in 2015. Since 2019, we&#x27;ve been working on Nabla (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nabla.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nabla.com</a>), an intelligent assistant for health practitioners.<p>When GPT-3 was released in 2020, we investigated it&#x27;s usage in a medical context[0], to mixed results.<p>Since then we’ve kept exploring opportunities at the intersection of healthcare and AI, and noticed that doctors spend am awful lot of time on medical documentation (writing clinical notes, updating their EHR, etc.).<p>Today, we&#x27;re releasing Nabla Copilot, a Chrome extension generating clinical notes from video consultations, to address this problem.<p>You can try it out, without installation nor sign up, on our demo page: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nabla.com&#x2F;copilot-demo&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nabla.com&#x2F;copilot-demo&#x2F;</a><p>Here’s how it works under the hood:<p>- When a doctor starts a video consultation, our Chrome extension auto-starts itself and listens to the active tab as well as the doctor’s microphone.<p>- We then transcribe the consultation using a fine-tuned version of Whisper. We&#x27;ve trained Whisper with tens of thousands of hours of medical consultation and medical terms recordings, and we have now reached an error rate which is 3× lower than Google&#x27;s Speech-To-Text.<p>- Once we have the transcript, we feed it to a heavily trained GPT-3, which generates a clinical note.<p>- We finally return the clinical note to the doctor through our Chrome extension, the doctor can copy it to their EHR, and send a version to the patient.<p>This allows doctors to be fully focused on their consultation, and saves them a lot time.<p>Next, we want to make this work for in-person consultation.<p>We also want to extract structured data (in the FHIR standard) from the clinical note, and feed it to the doctor’s EHR so that it is automatically added to the patient&#x27;s record.<p>Happy to further discuss technical details in comments!<p>---<p>[0]: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nabla.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;gpt-3&#x2F;"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nabla.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;gpt-3&#x2F;</a>",
