Over the weekend (leaning heavily on Opus 4.5) I wrote Jargon - an AI-managed zettelkasten that reads articles, papers, and YouTube videos, extracts the key ideas, and automatically links related concepts together.<p>Demo video: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;W7ejMqZ6EUQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;W7ejMqZ6EUQ</a><p>Repo: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;schoblaska&#x2F;jargon"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;schoblaska&#x2F;jargon</a><p>You can paste an article, PDF link, or YouTube video to parse, or ask questions directly and it&#x27;ll find its own content. Sources get summarized, broken into insight cards, and embedded for semantic search. Similar ideas automatically cluster together. Each insight can spawn research threads - questions that trigger web searches to pull in related content, which flows through the same pipeline.<p>You can explore the graph of linked ideas directly, or ask questions and it&#x27;ll RAG over your whole library plus fresh web results.<p>Jargon uses Rails + Hotwire with Falcon for async processing, pgvector for embeddings, Exa for neural web search, crawl4ai as a fallback scraper, and pdftotext for academic papers.",github.com
