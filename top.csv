That&#x27;s natural order of things of course, but because of limited opportunities of face to face contacts I didn&#x27;t really have a chance to listen to people&#x27;s problems and challenges. I work as full time software engineer, but also I do a lot of experiments and side projects. Because of that I&#x27;ve accumulated lots of different impressions and perspectives.<p>So I&#x27;m asking here: what would you like to read about, what are your current doubts about programming in general or related to dreaded by many subject of JavaScript and frontend frameworks. Is there any &#x27;next level&#x27; you&#x27;d like to reach?<p>This question can help many other people in situation similar to mine. Thanks!",

L0in,15,29510827,12,1639149330,"Ask HN: How do you deal with hobbies, etc., when you have diagnosed depression?",story,,"I have depression all of my life, i believe since 13, now i&#x27;m in my early 20s and i&#x27;ve been diagnosed by my ex-therapist with severe depression and anxiety. I started anti-depression meds over the last week but haven&#x27;t seen any changes for the better.<p>Currently i&#x27;m living a very dark chapter of my life, and i can&#x27;t do anything. Essentially i have anhedonia but also feeling guilty that i don&#x27;t do anything. I want to do something like read a book, watch a movie, study for my degree, search for work, but my thoughts go directly to &quot;It&#x27;s pointless&quot;, &quot;how reading a book will get you out of this mess, that&#x27;s partly your fault?&quot; (I appreciate that my depression doesn&#x27;t put all the blame on me hahaha), &quot;you will 100% fail&quot;, &quot;you are broken and not like the others&quot;, &quot;you can&#x27;t defend yourself if someone is trying to abuse your rights.&quot; etc.<p>The only thing i do every day is go out and try to be surrounded by others in social settings all the time. It kinda relaxes me.  Wake up -&gt; staying in bed for hours browsing mindless things on SM -&gt; go out and return early the next morning -&gt; sleep. Repeat.<p>The difficult part is that my feelings enforce my thoughts and vice versa.",
