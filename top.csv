jmg421,24,44682033,36,1753443499,Show HN: I built a biological network visualization tool,story,https://nodes.bio,"I&#x27;ve been working on nodes.bio - an interactive tool for visualizing biological networks and systems thinking.
The tool features interactive network visualization powered by Cytoscape.js, with real-time graph editing and manipulation capabilities. It supports JSON import&#x2F;export and provides a responsive design that works seamlessly on the desktop (mobile-friendly version coming later).<p>The tech stack combines modern frontend technologies with robust backend architecture. The frontend uses Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Cytoscape.js for the visualization engine. The backend is built with FastAPI and Python.<p>The featured demo showcases a Traumatic Brain Injury Nasal Spray mechanism of action visualization, demonstrating the tool&#x27;s capability to handle complex biological pathway mapping.<p>You can explore the live demo at &lt;<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodes.bio"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodes.bio</a>&gt; to see the TBI Nasal Spray visualization in action, along with other biological network examples.<p>I&#x27;d love feedback on the visualization capabilities or any suggestions for biological data integration. What do you think?",nodes.bio

_neil,39,44661673,195,1753291403,Show HN: Apple Health MCP Server,story,https://github.com/neiltron/apple-health-mcp,"Hey HN,<p>This is an MCP server to chat with Apple Health data. I built it because I&#x27;m working on (yet another) personal trainer tool that keeps track of my workout goals, etc. and does scheduling for me. Part of that is weekly check-ins. I thought pairing those check-ins with sensor data could be useful, so here we are.<p>It seems there isn&#x27;t a way to automate access to Apple Health data, so this relies on an iOS app that can quickly&#x2F;easily export key data to CSV. So the process at the moment is to export the data every Sunday before doing a check-in. More steps than I&#x27;d like, but in practice isn&#x27;t a big lift.<p>Under the hood this is mostly a thin wrapper around duckdb.<p>There&#x27;s a video of it in action here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;realtron&#x2F;status&#x2F;1947710791521591514"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;realtron&#x2F;status&#x2F;1947710791521591514</a>",github.com

Lines 900-970 were just cryptic numbers that made no sense to me. Finally figured it out decades later.<p>Turns out it&#x27;s machine learning from the 1970s! The AI learns by literally deleting bad moves from an array. After losing ~10 games, it becomes unbeatable. Just 19 board states, no neural networks, no fancy algorithms.<p>Martin Gardner (who wrote about it) also mentioned MENACE - a tic-tac-toe learning machine made with matchboxes and beads. Same principle, physical implementation.<p>Made a JavaScript version if anyone wants to try. The AI really does get better.",sublevelgames.github.io
