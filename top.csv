mNovak,91,38120388,208,1698960362,Tell HN: Submit comments to IRS re tax treatment of software dev expenses,story,,"Public comments can be submitted regarding IRS Notice 2023-63 &quot;Guidance on Amortization of Specified Research or Experimental Expenditures under Section 174,&quot; here:
<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.regulations.gov&#x2F;document&#x2F;IRS-2023-0040-0003&#x2F;comment"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.regulations.gov&#x2F;document&#x2F;IRS-2023-0040-0003&#x2F;comm...</a><p>The guidance in question can be found here:
<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;pub&#x2F;irs-drop&#x2F;n-23-63.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irs.gov&#x2F;pub&#x2F;irs-drop&#x2F;n-23-63.pdf</a><p>There was previous discussion of these rules on HN here:
<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35614313"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35614313</a><p>To very briefly summarize, these rules force certain research expenses to be treated under Section 174 and thus capitalized and amortized over a period of 5 years, instead of under Section 162 (ordinary and necessary business expenses) which are immediately deducted in the year they occur.<p>Part of the issue is the extremely broad classification of &quot;research expenses&quot;. Notably, it classifies virtually all software development as research, as well as the proportional share of all overhead&#x2F;fringe expenses. It also changes the treatment of contracted research activities (note that includes software). This has a hugely negative impact for early-stage startups, contract research firms (i.e. SBIR companies), and independent software developers.<p>To construct a basic example:<p><pre><code>  Revenue:  $100k 
  Expenses: $100k (developer salaries)
  Net operating income:  $0
  Taxable income: $100k - 0.1x100k = $90k (first year deduction is 10% of SREs)
</code></pre>
Come tax time, you now owe the government $18-30k taxes on your $0 real income.",

SeanAnderson,10,38101022,23,1698857273,Show HN: Symbiants – digital ant farm / mental health companion,story,https://ant.care/,"Hello HN! Hope you are well.<p>I&#x27;m creating my first video game. It&#x27;s nowhere near complete, but I am eager for feedback, so here I am!<p>My game is a digital ant farm. You should think SimAnt + Tamagotchi. Here&#x27;s a picture: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;dIJaraG.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;dIJaraG.png</a><p>It&#x27;s written in Rust&#x2F;Bevy, compiled to WASM, and is open-source, <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MeoMix&#x2F;symbiants"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MeoMix&#x2F;symbiants</a>. Fair warning, though, this is my first time writing in Rust&#x2F;Bevy.<p>My goal is to give people cute ants that do cute ant stuff 24&#x2F;7, ask people to look after their ants and to feed them once-per-day, and then deny people the ability to provide ant care unless they engage in mental health exercises.<p>I started working on this project for a few reasons:<p>1) I&#x27;ve been a dev for ~15 years, but, on a personal level, I have very little to show for it. I&#x27;ve worked on multiple, multi-year projects which were subsequently shut down by lawyers and, frankly, I&#x27;m tired of practicing non-attachment with my work. So, I&#x27;m creating this as a personal affirmation.<p>2) I enjoy my fully-remote, WFH lifestyle, but I find myself more isolated than ever. The lack of disruption allows for some serious focus. Sometimes I get so focused on a project that days slip by without me practicing self-care, and I&#x27;ll keep going until my output wanes due to lack of healthy behaviors. I thought having a digital companion who is interested in ensuring I remain consistent in caring for myself, by expecting consistent care for itself, would be effective and beneficial.<p>3) Ants are sweet. Obviously there should be more ant sims. :)<p>Currently, &quot;Sandbox Mode&quot; is all that exists. This mode provides the user with developer tools and allows them to treat the world like an unbounded playground. I use this mode for prototyping. In the future, I&#x27;ll combine mechanics from Sandbox Mode with cutscenes to create a more restrictive&#x2F;compelling Story Mode.<p>Sandbox Mode includes the following features:<p>* Queen Ant spawns, searches for a nesting spot, and begins to dig out a nest by hauling sand to the surface.<p>* Queen Ant establishes a nest and begins rearing worker ants once per hour.<p>* Worker Ants haul sand to the surface and emergently expand the nest with tunnels&#x2F;chambers when they feel cramped.<p>* Ants get hungry and starve if not fed every 24 hours.<p>* Sand-fall physics applies to the environment. Food, sand tumble down surfaces.<p>* Basic day&#x2F;night cycle. Sky background lightens&#x2F;darkens with time of day.<p>* Option to link in-game time to real-world time and to sync sunrise&#x2F;sunset.<p>* Ants go to sleep at night.<p>* Ants emote when sleeping and eating food.<p>* User Actions allow user to spawn sand, dirt, food, and ants. You can kill ants, despawn ants, despawn food, and select entities, too.<p>* Settings allow user to affect simulation speed (Sandbox Mode only), ant color, etc.<p>* Breathwork Prompt encourages user to meditate on a loose schedule in exchange for feeding ants.<p>Today, I am working on adding eggs to the birthing lifecycle and then allowing ants to carry eggs as well as other, dead ants. :)<p>If you&#x27;d like to read more about my stretch goals for Story Mode, feel free to peruse my ramblings. The high-level goal is to create a homage to Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky,  <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;17ACH1XLCn7hkKz2dhuL1c_nxbGOTZdUY6jJPsY_xA6I&#x2F;edit#heading=h.4iljwczfftys"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;document&#x2F;d&#x2F;17ACH1XLCn7hkKz2dhuL1c_nx...</a><p>If you&#x27;d like to talk more directly - my email is in my profile or you can reach me through Discord - <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;Qugp2Es4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;Qugp2Es4</a><p>So, what do you think?<p>Good idea with poor execution?<p>Love everything and just want to see more?<p>Feel that I&#x27;m just throwing away time with a non-viable starter?<p>Want to help but don&#x27;t know where to start?<p>Let me hear it!
