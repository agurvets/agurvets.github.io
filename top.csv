The lighting is fully ray traced in real-time and there is powerful cellular-automata based programming system, which allows to create complex digital circuits and model the behaviour of voxels (behaviour such as falling sand or water).<p>Technology wise, I&#x27;m using WebGL2 for the rendering and the simulation is coded in C89 and gets compiled to WebAssembly (with multi-threading) using Clang. The simulation is basically a custom cellular automaton and is fully parallelized. Once WebGPU is released, I&#x27;m planning to run the simulation on the GPU, instead of the CPU, which will give a massive speed up.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on this project full-time for over a year now, and finally came to the point of realising a public version of it to play with. There is already some really cool stuff that the community has built, and it&#x27;s super fun to see how everything evolves!<p>Let me know what you think and feel free to ask any questions :&gt;",voxelchain.app
