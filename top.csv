garrinm,14,37243171,37,1692832558,"Show HN: Chat with GPT about medical issues, get answers from medical literature",story,https://github.com/clint-llm/clint-llm.github.io,"Clint is an open-sourced medical information lookup and reasoning tool.<p>Clint enables a user to have an interactive dialogue about medical conditions, symptoms, or simply to ask medical questions. Clint helps connect regular health concerns with complex medical information. It does this by converting colloquial language into medical terms, gathering and understanding information from medical resources, and presenting this information back to the user in an easy-to-understand way.<p>One of the key features of Clint is that its processing is local. It&#x27;s served using GitHub pages and utilizes the user&#x27;s OpenAI API key to make requests to directly to GPT. All processing, except for that done by the LLM, happens in the user&#x27;s browser.<p>I recently had a need to lookup detailed medical information and found myself spending a lot of time translating my understanding into the medical domain, then again trying to comprehend the medical terms. That gave me the idea that this could be a task for an LLM.<p>The result is Clint. It&#x27;s a proof-of-concept. I currently have no further plans for the tool. If it is useful to you as-is, great! If it is useful only to help share some ideas, that&#x27;s fine too.",github.com
