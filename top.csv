• block-level codec polymorphism (different compression per block)
• streaming-first layout (no global seek required)
• better crash recovery characteristics
• plugin-based architecture so proprietary codecs can exist without changing the format<p>Right now this is an experimental v0.x format.
The specification may still change and compatibility is not guaranteed yet.<p>I’m mainly looking for feedback on the format design rather than performance comparisons.<p>Thanks for taking a look.",github.com
