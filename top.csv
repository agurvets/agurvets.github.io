Lines 900-970 were just cryptic numbers that made no sense to me. Finally figured it out decades later.<p>Turns out it&#x27;s machine learning from the 1970s! The AI learns by literally deleting bad moves from an array. After losing ~10 games, it becomes unbeatable. Just 19 board states, no neural networks, no fancy algorithms.<p>Martin Gardner (who wrote about it) also mentioned MENACE - a tic-tac-toe learning machine made with matchboxes and beads. Same principle, physical implementation.<p>Made a JavaScript version if anyone wants to try. The AI really does get better.",sublevelgames.github.io
